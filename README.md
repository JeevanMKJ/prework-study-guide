# Prework Study Guide

## Description

I was motivated to create this Prewok-Study-Guide to support me in my studies for the LPS coding bootcamp. 
This study guide helps me keep track of what Iâ€™ve learned, organising it coherently thus enabling me to access it in the future. This web page also serves as a learning tool for fellow PLS students, web development learners as well as anyone interested in using these notes as a stating off point of there on research. Or simply using the code as a stating off point for their own project. 

Apart from grasping an introductory understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Terminal, GitHub and GitPages
